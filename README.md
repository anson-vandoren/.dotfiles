# Managing machine configuration

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. I tend to switch machines frequently, and like to minimize the
amount of headaches I need to go through to get a new one set up the way I like it. This repo
contains my efforts to automate as much of that process as I can, and document as much as possible.

Note that it is ill-advised to blindly use my exact dotfiles. It is highly unlikely they will be
suitable for anyone else as-is. Instead, I recommend reading through the files I have to see what
makes sense for your situation. I've tried to list why I made the choices I did so you can see
if it fits your needs. If you have suggestions or spot anything wrong, feel free to open an issue
or PR.
